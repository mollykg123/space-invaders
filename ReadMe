Description

Instructions

Here, give a short description of the project. It can be a couple of sentences where you discuss the point in time during the course that you completed it, the topic of the project and potentially the tech stack.

Insert your Description here:



Deployment link

Instructions

Here include the information on where the deployed project can be found. If login details are needed to access the full project, make sure you include them.

If you have not yet deployed your project, you can add this in later.

Insert your Deployment link here:




Getting Started/Code Installation

Instructions

Explain how the reader accesses your code. Include a step by step approach.

Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

Instructions

Share the timeframe given for the project and whether you worked independently, in a pair, or in a group.

If you worked in a pair or group, include the names of the people you collaborated with. As a bonus, you can also provide links to their GitHub repo.

Insert your Timeframe & Working Team here:





Technologies Used

Instructions

List every technology you used to complete the project. This can be in one long list, or broken down into categories (Back End, Front End, Development Tools).

Insert your Technologies Used here:





Brief
Instructions

Include the brief set by your instructional team here. This sets the context of the project you were working towards and mimics briefs you will be set later in your future roles.

This can either be in bullets or in a paragraph.

Planning

Instructions

The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices. 

Start by explaining the initial steps you took in the project. 

Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.

Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.
- did a wire frame of start page
- wire frame of main page to help with layout, this changed whne i implemented it on wireframe
Any ERDs? Same here, explain and include images.
- ERD?
Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use? How you allocated tickets/responsibilities, sprint timeline etc. Also include screenshots of this.

Any pseudocode? 
If it was a group or pair project - Discuss who was designated which tasks. This is very important, as engineers want to understand who owned the different code elements when looking at a group project.

For each project, review the above bullets and discuss every step you took in the planning stage, including the relevant images.

Not every project will include the above, but it’s important to discuss any of the bullets that you did implement.

Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions. 

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across? 
Why were these challenges? 
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here:
Styling
- galaga and tekken logo's for H1 - learnt translateX


JavaScript
- moving an array of opponents automatically around on the board



Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

Insert your Wins here:


Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Insert your Key Learnings/Takeaways here:





Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Insert your Bugs here:



Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
